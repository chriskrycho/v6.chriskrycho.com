This piece took less than 48 hours: from the initial idea to a finished recording.

**The idea:** 40 notes for 40 days and nights—reflecting on the loneliness of Christ in the desert, and on the Christian practice of Lent.

**The process:** sitting quietly at his slightly-out-of-tune Yamaha upright piano, *feeling* out the duration of each of those 40 notes, iterating on

**The recording:** at that same Yamaha upright with a decent studio microphone just inside the lid, doing takes with Logic Pro until it sounded right.

**The mix:** Chris’ friend and former colleague [Bryan Levay](http://bryanlevay.com/) kindly took an afternoon both to do the mix and to show Chris the ropes a bit when it came to mixing.

For a bit more background, see [Chris’ write-up](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/elsewhere/the-desert/) accompanying the release.
