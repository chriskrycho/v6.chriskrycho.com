            <p>
               I love building software. I did not expect this when I started, and I did
               not come to this career with a great deal of purpose at first. Programming
               was just a good-enough job I could land with a physics degree in hand
               straight out of college. It has become a lasting passion, though. I told my
               wife recently: I can imagine a world where I worked full time as a
               composer…&nbsp;but in that world I would be still writing software as a
               hobby on the side, because it is such a joy to me.
            </p>
            <p>
               Software is also incredibly important to the world as it is — whether you
               like it or not. I think often of Marc Andreessen’s line that<span
                  class="push-double"
               ></span>
               <span class="pull-double">“</span>software is eating the world”: for so it
               is. Where a venture capitalist sees that primarily in terms of the enormous
               piles of money it represents, though, I see it in terms of the many people
               who use software not by choice but necessity. For every person like me who
               really enjoys digital technologies and puts them at the center of their
               work, there are many others for whom computing is at best ancillary to
               their actual work, indeed for whom it might just be in the <em>way</em> of
               doing their real work.
            </p>
            <p>
               Think of the person cutting your hair: the software in the point-of-sale
               system. Think of a single parent wrangling school activity schedules
               through Facebook. Think of the Uber driver. Think of people making a living
               selling craft-work on Etsy. Think of the small businesses who have to
               advertise on Instagram. Think of the people just trying to pay for parking
               on the way to do something else.
            </p>
            <p>
               Those of us who practice software engineering owe it to all of those people
               to make software which works well, which works <em>for them</em>. Period.
            </p>
            <p>
               <span class="pull-double">“</span>Solving” the problem of poor software
               craft is an impossible problem. I mean that: <em>impossible</em>. Poor
               craft is the result of massive systemic problems as well as many individual
               failures. It will always exist, because people will remain people:
               sometimes lazy or unmotivated or just stressed out by other things going on
               in their lives, sometimes greedy and short-sighted and foolish.
            </p>
            <p>We can make it <em>better</em>, though.</p>
            <p>I increasingly value tools and processes which do one of two things:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <span class="pull-double">“</span>Raise the floor”: cutting down both
                  the number and severity of bugs we ship.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <span class="pull-double">“</span>Raise the ceiling” by making it
                  possible to deliver more interesting features.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
               There are many such: processes like code review, techniques like
               <abbr title="test-driven development">TDD</abbr> and
               <abbr title="domain-driven design">DDD</abbr>, and correct-by-construction
               <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> designs; tools
               like formal modeling; improvements in our programming languages; formal
               verification; and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
               Unfortunately, many of these techniques enable and sustain progress only so
               long as everyone can operate like a very senior engineer on her best days.
               All of us should strive for that kind of excellence — but not one of us is
               always at our best. What is more, many of us have a long way to go before
               we are even able to operate that way. Every one of us started out as a
               junior engineer, after all.
            </p>
            <p>
               The real wins, then, are tools which do not require everyone to be at their
               best at every moment: <em>ratchets</em>, not <em>levers</em>. Levers let
               you move things, but if you are holding something up with a lever, you have
               to keep holding it — forever. A ratchet lets you drive forward motion
               <em>without</em> slipping back as soon as you let up on the pressure.
            </p>
            <p>
               This is why I care so much about
               <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a>. This is why I spent so much
               of the past decade working on
               <a href="https://typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a> adoption. This is even
               why I invested in the work I did on Ember Octane and
               <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/topics/ember"
                  >produced so much material about it</a
               >. Each of those was (and is!) just such a ratchet, albeit to varying
               degrees and in various contexts. Rust is a particularly good example: it
               lets us ship faster software<sup class="footnote-ref"
                  ><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup
               >
               with fewer bugs in areas that really matter, and it enables a
               <em>lot</em> more people to do that kind of work than were able to do so
               (especially: to do so <em>safely</em> for their users) with C and C++. You
               can trust a junior to ship high-performance<span
                  class="push-double"
               ></span>
               <span class="pull-double">“</span>close-to-the-metal” code written in Rust
               without worrying about memory safety; your team can focus more on
               architecture than on running valgrind. Rust is a ratchet.
            </p>
            <p>
               Ratchets are incremental improvements, not silver bullets. So was
               structured programming, though. A change does not have to be a silver
               bullet to be valuable.
               <span class="sans">It just has to make for better software</span> — and
               critically, better software that does not require you to be always at your
               best. Fewer <code>SEGFAULT</code>s and fewer vulnerabilities as a result of
               memory safety is good. Fewer cases of<span class="push-double"></span>
               <span class="pull-double">“</span><code>undefined</code> is not a function”
               is good.
               <a
                  href="https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2018/scales-of-feedback-time-in-software-development.html"
                  >Faster cycle times</a
               >
               on identifying and fixing bugs is good.
            </p>
            <p>
               So what I am doing next? Hopefully, making a ratchet — and teaching people
               how to use it, because that combination of craft and education is what I
               love most, and what I am best at.<sup class="footnote-ref"

                  ></span>
                  <span class="pull-double">“</span>ratchet-building” work:

                     <p>
                        Many product companies are appropriately focused on dramatically
                        raising the experience of people working in those other
                        industries. This is good: Software can be a very powerful ratchet
                        for other industries. Unless the target industry is is software
                        development itself, though, it is not the kind of ratchet I have
                        in mind.
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>
                        Lots of companies are quite rightly interested in ratcheting up
                        their own developers’ experience. I find that extremely admirable,
                        and in fact it is what I spent the past five years doing. Purely
                        internal platform and engineering enablement work is also not the
                        kind of ratchet I have in mind, though.
                     </p>

               </ol>
               <p>
                  There are many ways to build ratchets for the software industry,
                  including — but not limited to — open source software. The key is that
                  my aim is specifically (a) to improve the craft of software and (b) in
                  ways that directly benefit whoever I work for
                  <em>and</em> contribute to the software industry more generally.

                        Acquaintances and long-time readers might wonder how this connects
                        to my long-standing involvement in the Ember.js community. I am
                        glad for the time I spent working on things in the Ember
                        community, and for several enduring friendships I made there.
                        However, as of my resignations from the Ember Framework Core Team
                        late last spring and from the Ember TypeScript Core Team in the
                        fall, I am done working on Ember in any ongoing way. I still think
                        there is interesting work to be done in the front-end web space,
                        but I will be doing it in other contexts.
