Chris is a composer of contemporary classical music—think somewhere between John Williams and John Tavener—with recent works ranging from small chamber pieces written for friends to a fanfare recorded with the [Budapest Scoring Orchestra][bso]. (He is also a [software engineer][cv], [writer][v5], and more.)

He began composing in earnest in 7th grade, when he wrote an orchestral arrangement of Martin Luther's “A Mighty Fortress is Our God” for a local [Clavinova Festival][clavinova]. Although he continued studying piano, with a widening focus on popular and improvisatory styles for a church worship band, his emphasis over the course of high school shifted increasingly to pure composition.

He continued studying composition in [the University of Oklahoma's School of Music][ou-music], completing the full course of composition studies under Dr. Marvin Lamb while graduating with a Bachelor's of Physics.

After graduation, he continued composing occasionally, but the busyness of being early in a career in software development, the addition of two delightful daughters, and a graduate degree pushed music to the side throughout much of the 2010's. In 2020, he jumped back into composing with his [<cite>Fanfare for a New Era of American Spaceflight</cite>][fanfare], written in honor of the SpaceX Crew Dragon Demo launch, and has not stopped since.
