                  Self-biographies are a bit weird. No two ways around it. But they
                  <em>do</em> give us a chance to think about how we present ourselves to
                  the world. So when I say —

                  my own, but I was bought with a price — and that price was the death of

                  Since graduating college, I have been working more or less full-time in
                  the software industry. I starting out writing avionics software and then
                  hazards and risk mitigation software for the energy industry. After
                  picking up web development on the side, I eventually transitioned into
                  web development full time. You can see my
                  <a href="/cv/"><abbr title="curriculum vitae">CV</abbr></a> for the
                  nitty-gritty professional-historical details! Below are just the salient
                  bits of what I’m doing <em>right now</em>.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Most recently I was a Senior Staff Software Engineer at LinkedIn,
                  working on front-end infrastructure for what most people think of when
                  you say LinkedIn: the app you sign into, send messages and read updates
                  on, etc. For the past few years, I served as the tech lead for the
                  flagship app and as the primary subject matter expert for LinkedIn’s
                  TypeScript adoption effort. In 2021 I led LinkedIn’s adoption of
                  <a href="https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/">Ember Octane</a> — a
                  project I had been doing prep work for in the app since August 2019. I
                  was also a member of the Ember Framework core team, and since 2017 (well
                  before I joined LinkedIn) I was one of several people driving forward
                  <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a> adoption in the
                  Ember community — culminating with the creation of the Ember TypeScript
                  core team in 2022.

               <p>
                  I have increasingly come to see much of my calling in life as that of
                  the
                  <em>public theologian</em>. Doing public theology means (at least) two
                  things:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     doing theological work <em>for</em> the church <em>in</em> public
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     doing theological work <em>from</em> the church <em>for</em> the
                     public
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                  When I am doing theological work <em>for</em> the church
                  <em>in public</em>, I aim for the good of the church. It is not merely
                  for intellectual interest; when it is, I’m off the rails. The point of
                  this kind of public theology is to equip other Christians to think well:
                  God and his work in our world, and of our right response to his work.
               </p>
               <p>
                  When I am doing theological work <em>from</em> the church
                  <em>for</em> the public, I aim for the good of the world in which the
                  church is set. As with work for the church, this cannot be merely a
                  matter of satisfying my curiosity. It also cannot be done
                  <em>solo</em>:<span class="push-double"></span>
                  <span class="pull-double">“</span>public theology” done outside the
                  church — that is, not <em>from</em> the church — is also off the rails.
                  My aims in this mode are to make Christianity intelligible to those for
                  whom it is simply perplexing, and to apply robustly Christian thought to
                  matters of the day.
               </p>
               <p>
                  These two modes are complements — not competitors. Done well, each
                  benefits the other.

                  Since college, I have written — a <em>lot</em> — primarily on various
                  iterations of chriskrycho.com, but also occasionally at
                  <a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com">Mere Orthodoxy</a>, and between

                  increasingly conceive of my public writing along two axes:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <p>
                        <i>public theology:</i> writing in line with that vocation of
                        <i>public theologian</i> is the work that I care most about,
                        though it is also the work that is hardest in many ways: it’s
                        where the bar is highest.
                     </p>
                  </li>

                        sharing what I’m learning — both so that the things I learn,
                        others gain benefit from, and so that I myself have a good trail
                        to follow in the future!

                  Since 2010, I have been a long-distance runner. A bout of mono left me
                  incredibly weak, and a desire to get back in shape to play
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)">Ultimate</a>
                  with friends led me to spend a lot of time running over the next year.
                  The running stuck: I <em>miss</em> playing Ultimate, but nothing stops
                  me from running regularly. I’ve also completed a super sprint triathlon,
                  and cycle regularly… but running is my favorite.

                  In high school and college, I studied and practiced musical composition,
                  mostly in a neoclassical/neoromantic vein. That interest lay dormant for
                  most of a decade after college. I composed the processional for my own
                  wedding as well as both of my little sisters’ weddings and the themes
                  for all of my podcasts, but little else. Then, in 2020, I picked back up
                  my composer’s pen and have not put it down.

                  at work on a large-scale symphonic work, along with some chamber works
                  and some church music. Some or all of that may appear here in the

                  In January 2014, my long-time friend
                  <a href="https://stephencarradini.com">Stephen Carradini</a> and I
                  launched <a href="https://winningslowly.org">Winning Slowly</a> — a
                  podcast about tech, religion, ethics, and art. He called it a tech
                  podcast with other angles; I called it our excuse to talk about
                  literally every part of human existence. We were both right. And you
                  wouldn’t be wrong to see it as another spot where I consciously
                  practiced <i>public theology</i>.

               <p>
                  Out of that initial experiment grew a general interest in podcasting as

                        3½-year-long podcast about the Rust programming language, in which
                        I tried something that as far as I know no one else had done
                        before: teaching a programming language through a podcast.

                        eventually. It’s been hard to carve out the time for it the last
                        couple years, but we always enjoy it when we do!

                  I find podcasting a great complement to writing. It is available in
                  spaces and places where people cannot read (like commuting), and it’s
                  also a great place to flesh out thoughts I have already put in writing
                  or am trying to figure out how to put in writing. While I am not
                  currently producing any podcasts, I will not rule out the possibility of
                  doing so again in the future — and I am happy to be a guest on
                  <em>other</em> podcasts!

                           Paul was writing specifically about sexual immorality — but the
                           form of his argument is to ground that specific injunction in a
                           very sweeping, indeed a totalizing, claim about the Christian
                           life. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a>
